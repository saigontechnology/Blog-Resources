00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Track 17. Unit 3. Listening. Exercise 3.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good evening and welcome aboard the Pride of Pool.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this recorded announcement, we'll give you details of some of the facilities available on board this ship.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're currently standing in the reception area in the centre of B-Deck.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If you're feeling hungry after a long day's travelling, go up the stairs to A-Deck where you'll find the restaurant.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The restaurant caters for all appetites, with anything from a light snack to a full three-course meal.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The restaurant will be open from the moment the ship leaves port to half an hour before arrival.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Next to the restaurant on A-Deck in the lounge, there are reclining seats with music headphones if you want to relax.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The headphones are free, but people using this area are encouraged to keep noise to a minimum,

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
so that other passengers can enjoy themselves and sleep or read if they wish.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For those of you who'd like some entertainment, just next door to us on this deck is a 40-seat cinema.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Showing the latest full-length feature films.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The cinema programme is available here at reception, but you'll have to buy the tickets themselves at the cinema entrance, just before you go in.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just next to the cinema is the staircase leading down to the cabins on C-Deck.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
To access your cabin, just show your boarding pass to a steward who will give you the key.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:57,000
On this deck, that is B-Deck, you'll also find an area where you can either play games in our special electronic games arcade or do your shopping.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Just beyond that, on the same level, people who want a bit of fresh air or just want to see the sea can go out onto the viewing deck, which is in the open air.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Make sure you wear a jacket or coat as it can be quite cold and windy.
